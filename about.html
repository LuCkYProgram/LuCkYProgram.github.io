## About

A phrase that I’ve read earlier when I was in the fruition of exploring my passions has ultimately solidified my future. “Data are just summaries of thousands of stories – tell a few of those stories to help make the data meaningful.” A quote by the Heath Brothers where they’ve introduced the representation of information around the world and how it creates the atmospheric reality of what simple numbers can do and the innovation they bring. I want to experience firsthand in the field and create things knowing that I can encounter new discoveries in the fronts of sciences and the dilemmas that we face every day. Since data science can be applied to any of the categories that gather information, I’m looking forward to finding a specific path of data science such as statistics. 
I've started out my journey in data by attending MSU and through the hands on classroom sessions. Joining in the local community of the club of AI and further starting my career in an intern in Humana, I further embark on a ambitious jounrey of what storys that numbers tell.
